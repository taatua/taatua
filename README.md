- ⚡ Fun fact: There are more possible iterations of a game of chess than there are atoms in the known universe. The number of possible unique chess games is estimated to be around 10^120, while the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe is "only" about 10^80. This incredible complexity highlights the vastness and richness of the game of chess, which has fascinated minds for centuries!
